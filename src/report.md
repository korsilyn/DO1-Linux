# Report of DO1 by florencm
## Part 1. Installation of the OS
### == Task ==
Install Ubuntu 20.04 Server LTS without GUI. (Use VirtualBox).

    There should be no GUI.
    Check Ubuntu version by running the command
    cat /etc/issue
    Add a screenshot of the command output to the report.

![cat /etc/issue](assets/1.png)
## Part 2. Creating a user
### == Task ==
Create a user other than the one created during installation. The user must be added to adm group.

    Add a screenshot of command call to create user.
    The new user must be in the output of the command:
    cat /etc/passwd
    Add a screenshot of the command output.

![cat /etc/passwd](assets/2.2.png)

## Part 3. Setting up the OS network
### == Task ==

1. Set the machine name as user-1  
```
    To change machine name, we need to edit file /etc/hostname.  
    I used nano /etc/hostname and replaced "vm1" to "user-1"
```

2. Set the time zone corresponding to your current location.  
```
    To change timezone, we can use timedatectl:  
    timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Moscow
```
3. Output the names of the network interfaces using a console command.  
    In the report give an explanation for the presence of the lo interface.
```
    To output names of the NI, we can use next command:  
    ip l  

    lo is a loopback device. You can imagine it as a virtual network  
    device that is on all systems, even if they aren't connected to  
    any network. It has an IP address of 127.0.0.1 and can be used to  
    access network services locally.
```

4. Use the console command to get the ip address of the device you are working on from the DHCP server.  
    Decode DHCP in the report.
```
    To get the IP address, we can use next command:  
    ip a s ens3, where ens3 is my ethernet device from previous step  
    DHCP is decoded as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
```

5. Define and display the external ip address of the gateway (ip) and the internal IP address of the gateway, aka default ip address (gw).
```
    A default gateway is the node in a computer network using the Internet protocol  
    suite that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other  
    route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet. 

    Gateway have two IPs. One is an external IP address assigned by for example ISP,  
    and the other an internal IP address that is only accessible within your network   

    To get gateway internal and external IP, i used:  
    ip r | grep default  
    My external IP is 10.0.2.15, internal IP is 10.0.2.2
```

6. Set static (manually set, not received from DHCP server) ip, gw, dns settings (use public DNS servers, e.g. 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8).
```
    To set static ip, we need to edit /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml  
    We need to:  
    Set dhcp4 to false  
    Set addresses to [ 10.0.2.15/24 ]  
    Set gateway4 to 10.0.2.2  
    Set nameservers: addresses to [ 1.1.1.1 ]  
    Save file end enter netplan apply
```

7. Reboot the virtual machine. Make sure that the static network settings (ip, gw, dns) correspond to those set in the previous point.
```
    To check settings after reboot, we need to use ip r | grep default  
    We need to ensure, that there are 'static' now  
    To check DNS server, i used:  
    systemd-resolve --show | grep "DNS Server"  
    I have 1.1.1.1 in there
```
    Describe in the report what you have done to complete all seven points (you can do it in text or with screenshots).
    Successfully ping 1.1.1.1 and ya.ru remote hosts and add a screenshot of the output command to the report. There should be "0% packet loss" phrase in command output.

## Part 4. OS Update
### == Task ==

Update the system packages to the latest version

    After updating the system packages, if you enter the update command again, a message should appear saying there are no updates.
    Add a screenshot of this message to the report.
![apt-get](assets/4.png)

## Part 5. Using the sudo command
### == Task ==

Allow user created in Part 2 to execute sudo command.  
![usermod -aG sudo user](assets/5.1.png)  
```
    sudo allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users  
    ability to run commands as root or another user  
```

    In the report explain the true purpose of sudo command (donâ€™t write about the fact that this word is "magic" one).
    Change the OS hostname via the user created in Part 2 (using sudo).
    Add screenshot with changed hostname to the report.

![edited hostname](assets/5.2.png)
## Part 6. Installing and configuring the time service
### == Task ==

Set up the automatic time synchronisation service.

    Output the time of the time zone in which you are currently located.
    The output of the following command must contain NTPSynchronized=yes:
        timedatectl show
    Add screenshots of the correct time and command output to the report.

![timedaectl](assets/6.png)  

## Part 7. Installing and using text editors
### == Task ==

Install VIM text editor (+ any two others if you like NANO, MCEDIT, JOE etc.)

Using each of the three selected editors, create a test_X.txt file, where X is the name of the editor in which the file is created. Write your nickname in it, close the file and save the changes.

    Add screenshots to the report:
        Of each editor with the contents of the file before closing.
    Write down in the report what you have done to exit with the changes saved.

![vim](assets/7.1.png)  
To exit with the changes saved, you need to print :wq in command mode  
![nano](assets/7.2.png)  
To exit with the changes saved, you need to press ctrl+o and ctrl+x  
![micro](assets/7.3.png)  
To exit with the changes saved, you need to press ctrl+s and ctrl+q

Using each of the three selected editors, open the file for editing, edit the file by replacing the nickname with the "21 School 21" string, close the file without saving the changes.

    Add screenshots to the report:
        Of each editor with the contents of the file after editing.
    Write down in the report what you have done to exit without saving the changes.

![vim](assets/7.4.png)  
To exit without the changes saved, you need to print :q! in command mode  
![nano](assets/7.5.png)  
To exit without the changes saved, you need to press ctrl+x and choose not to save buffer  
![micro](assets/7.6.png)  
To exit without the changes saved, you need to press ctrl+q and choose not to save file

Using each of the three selected editors, edit the file again (similar to the previous point) and then master the functions of searching through the contents of a file (a word) and replacing a word with any other one.

    Add screenshots to the report:
        Of each editor with word search results.
        Of each editor with commands entered to replace a word with another.

## Part 8. Installing and basic setup of the SSHD service
### == Task ==

Install the SSHd service.  
```
apt-get install ssh  
```
Add an auto-start of the service whenever the system boots.  
```
systemctl enable ssh  
```
Reset the SSHd service to port 2022.  
```
To do this, I edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config and changed  
#Port 22 to  
Port 2022  
```
Show the presence of the sshd process using the ps command. To do this, you need to match the keys to the command.

    Explain in the report the meaning of the command and each key in it.

![ps](assets/8.1.png)  
```
ps shows processes in system. -u root show processes, that started from root/systemd daemon  
```
Reboot the system.

    Describe in the report what you have done to complete all five points (you can do this in text or with screenshots).
    The output of the netstat -tan command should contain
    tcp 0 0.0.0.0:2022 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN
    (if there is no netstat command, it needs to be installed)
    Add a screenshot of the command output to the report.
    Explain the meaning of the -tan keys, the value of each output column, the value 0.0.0.0. in the report.

![netstat](assets/8.2.png)  
```
-tan show only connected tcp connection, and n flag don't resolve name (ahows only numeric address)  
Proto is used protocol, recv-q and send-q is count of bytes received/sended  
Local address is inner address, Foreign address is external address  
State is state of socket  
0.0.0.0 means that this is lo socket, it listens itself on same vm
```

## Part 9. Installing and using the top, htop utilities
### == Task ==

        memory load: 127.6 mb
        pid of the process with the highest memory usage: 1
        pid of the process taking the most CPU time: 1103
    Add a screenshot of the htop command output to the report:
        sorted by PID, PERCENT_CPU, PERCENT_MEM, TIME
        filtered for sshd process
        with the syslog process found by searching
        with hostname, clock and uptime output added
